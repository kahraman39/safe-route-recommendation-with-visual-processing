In this project, I created a safe route system that recommends us to go on a path free of stray dogs, using the data received from street cameras. In the first stage, I created an artificial intelligence algorithm that recognizes dogs and detects their numbers with the help of Roboflow, and in the second stage, I created a route within the ITU campus by assigning penalty values to the data from the first stage and using the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm.
All photos should be in same folder with the .ipynb file. Also you could need install pip roboflow. Image names represents the locations
